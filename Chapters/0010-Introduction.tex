The Serums Project (Securing Medical Data in Smart Patient-Centric Healthcare Systems)\footnote{\url{https://www.serums-h2020.org/}} is an European Union Horizon 2020 research project that supports security and privacy of future-generation healthcare systems, placing the patients at the centre of future healthcare provision, enhancing their personal care and maximising the quality of treatment citizens receive. 

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows how the currently lack of integration and aggregation of healthcare data across the world.

Our hyper-scaling data crawler methodology enables processing factory that can process the data in the healthcare.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Data and information acquisition and processing (e.g., data crawling, data quality, data privacy, mitigating biases, and data wrangling)
    \item Integration and aggregation (e.g., semantic processing, data provenance, data linkage, data fusion, knowledge graphs, data warehousing, privacy and security, modelling, information credibility)
\end{itemize}

The solution enables the integration of healthcare data and knowledge for the next generation to support the sustainability, transparency and fairness of the worldwide view of the combined the healthcare.
