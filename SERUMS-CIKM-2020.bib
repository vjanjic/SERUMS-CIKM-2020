@article{Wyk2015,
abstract = {Global hyperconnectivity and increased system integration have led to vast benefits, including worldwide growth in incomes, education, innovation, and technology. But rapid globalization has also created concerns because the repercussions of local events now cascade over national borders and the fallout of financial meltdowns and environmental disasters affects everyone. The Butterfly Defect addresses the widening gap between systemic risks and their effective management. It shows how the new dynamics of turbo-charged globalization has the potential and power to destabilize our societies. Drawing on the latest insights from a wide variety of disciplines, Ian Goldin and Mike Mariathasan provide practical guidance for how governments, businesses, and individuals can better manage risk in our contemporary world. Goldin and Mariathasan assert that the current complexities of globalization will not be sustainable as surprises become more frequent and have widespread impacts. The recent financial crisis exemplifies the new form of systemic risk that will characterize the coming decades, and the authors provide the first framework for understanding how such risk will function in the twenty-first century. Goldin and Mariathasan demonstrate that systemic risk issues are now endemic everywhere—in supply chains, pandemics, infrastructure, ecology and climate change, economics, and politics. Unless we are better able to address these concerns, they will lead to greater protectionism, xenophobia, nationalism, and, inevitably, deglobalization, rising conflict, and slower growth. The Butterfly Defect shows that mitigating uncertainty and systemic risk in an interconnected world is an essential task for our future.},

Manufacturing times are general i.i.d. random variables, and different products may have different manufacturing-time distributions. Demands for the products are independent Poisson processes with different arrival rates. The costs of managing the production-inventory system are stationary and include inventory holding and backordering costs. Backordering costs may be {\$} per unit or {\$} per unit per unit time.

@book{Linstedt2015,
abstract = {The Data Vault was invented by Dan Linstedt at the U.S. Department of Defense, and the standard has been successfully applied to data warehousing projects at organizations of different sizes, from small to large-size corporations. Due to its simplified design, which is adapted from nature, the Data Vault 2.0 standard helps prevent typical data warehousing failures. "Building a Scalable Data Warehouse" covers everything one needs to know to create a scalable data warehouse end to end, including a presentation of the Data Vault modeling technique, which provides the foundations to create a technical data warehouse layer. The book discusses how to build the data warehouse incrementally using the agile Data Vault 2.0 methodology. In addition, readers will learn how to create the input layer (the stage layer) and the presentation layer (data mart) of the Data Vault 2.0 architecture including implementation best practices. Drawing upon years of practical experience and using numerous examples and an easy to understand framework, Dan Linstedt and Michael Olschimke discuss: How to load each layer using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), including automation of the Data Vault loading processes. Important data warehouse technologies and practices. Data Quality Services (DQS) and Master Data Services (MDS) in the context of the Data Vault architecture. Provides a complete introduction to data warehousing, applications, and the business context so readers can get-up and running fast. Explains theoretical concepts and provides hands-on instruction on how to build and implement a data warehouse. Demystifies data vault modeling with beginning, intermediate, and advanced techniques. Discusses the advantages of the data vault approach over other techniques, also including the latest updates to Data Vault 2.0 and multiple improvements to Data Vault 1.0.},

abstract = {Future-generation healthcare systems will be highly distributed, combining centralised hospital systems with decentralised home-, work-and environment-based monitoring and diagnostics systems. These will reduce costs and injury-related risks whilst both improving quality of service, and reducing the response time for diagnostics and treatments made available to patients. To make this vision possible, medical data must be accessed and shared over a variety of mediums including untrusted networks. In this paper, we present the design and initial implementation of the SERUMS tool-chain for accessing, storing, communicating and analysing highly confidential medical data in a safe, secure and privacy-preserving way. In addition, we describe a data fabrication framework for generating large volumes of synthetic but realistic data, that is used in the design and evaluation of the tool-chain. We demonstrate the present version of our technique on a use case derived from the Edinburgh Cancer Centre, NHS Lothian, where information about the effects of chemotherapy treatments on cancer patients is collected from different distributed databases, analysed and adapted to improve ongoing treatments.},

@article{EU2017,
abstract = {The GDPR is a far-reaching legal instrument that will have a significant impact on all companies involved in the processing of personal data, including many outside the EU. It will increase the penalties for noncompliance, with fines of up to €20 million or 4 percent of annual worldwide turnover. In addition, supervisory authorities will have a number of broad powers. Companies should review the GDPR and begin preparing for compliance with the new legal framework for data protection in the EU. This guide, by providing a brief overview of the new rules imposed by this legislation and the key changes it will make, will help users prepare for the GDPR. The guide also includes a short glossary of terms used in the GDPR, and each section sets out a short to-do list for compliance. The guide will shortly be followed by further guidance, briefings and practical checklists on the GDPR.},
