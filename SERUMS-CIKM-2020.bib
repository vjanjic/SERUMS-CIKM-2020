abstract = {Global hyperconnectivity and increased system integration have led to vast benefits, including worldwide growth in incomes, education, innovation, and technology. But rapid globalization has also created concerns because the repercussions of local events now cascade over national borders and the fallout of financial meltdowns and environmental disasters affects everyone. The Butterfly Defect addresses the widening gap between systemic risks and their effective management. It shows how the new dynamics of turbo-charged globalization has the potential and power to destabilize our societies. Drawing on the latest insights from a wide variety of disciplines, Ian Goldin and Mike Mariathasan provide practical guidance for how governments, businesses, and individuals can better manage risk in our contemporary world. Goldin and Mariathasan assert that the current complexities of globalization will not be sustainable as surprises become more frequent and have widespread impacts. The recent financial crisis exemplifies the new form of systemic risk that will characterize the coming decades, and the authors provide the first framework for understanding how such risk will function in the twenty-first century. Goldin and Mariathasan demonstrate that systemic risk issues are now endemic everywhere—in supply chains, pandemics, infrastructure, ecology and climate change, economics, and politics. Unless we are better able to address these concerns, they will lead to greater protectionism, xenophobia, nationalism, and, inevitably, deglobalization, rising conflict, and slower growth. The Butterfly Defect shows that mitigating uncertainty and systemic risk in an interconnected world is an essential task for our future.},

These will reduce costs and injury-related risks whilst both improving quality of service, and reducing the response time for diagnostics and treatments made available to patients. To make this vision possible, medical data must be accessed and shared over a variety of mediums including untrusted networks. In this paper, we present the design and initial implementation of the SERUMS tool-chain for accessing, storing, communicating and analysing highly confidential medical data in a safe, secure and privacy-preserving way. In addition, we describe a data fabrication framework for generating large volumes of synthetic but realistic data, that is used in the design and evaluation of the tool-chain.

Julia Hussein Editor in Chief, Sexual and Reproductive Health Matters, London, UK. Correspondence: julia.hussein@srhm.orgOn the 11 March 2020, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.[1] Other coronavirus outbreaks which have occurred include the 2002-03 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), first reported in 2012. Outbreaks like these can impact sexual and reproductive health and rights in various ways, at individual, systems and societal levels, and some of these implications are considered below. MERS and SARS are known to cause adverse pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage, prematurity, fetal growth restriction and maternal death.[2] Experience of COVID-19 in pregnancy is limited. In one reported case, the pregnant woman required mechanical ventilation and a caesarean section at 30 weeks gestation.[3] Fetal distress and preterm delivery were reported in some other cases where infection occurred in the third trimester.[4] Intrauterine virus transmission from mother to baby before delivery is a recognised risk,[5] although current expert opinion is that the fetus is unlikely to be exposed during pregnancy and transmission is more likely as a neonate.[6] Pregnant women with COVID-19 respiratory illness should be treated with priority because of the risk of complications. So far, there is no evidence that pregnant women are more susceptible to COVID-19 than the general population,[7] but pregnancy is nevertheless a risk factor for increased illness and death in outbreaks of influenza.[8] Systematic screening of suspected infection during pregnancy with extended follow-up of confirmed cases has been called for,[9] although the practicability of such measures - given often mild symptoms, lack of test kits and so on - is uncertain. Pregnant women face special challenges because of their responsibilities in the workforce, as caregivers of children and other family members, and their requirements for regular contact with maternity services and clinical settings where risk of exposure to infection is higher.[8] Functioning, well-resourced health systems are undoubtedlyneeded to manage the situation effectively. The outbreak is already placing health services in developed countries under considerable strain. The recommendations for maternity services alone, to limitpregnant women's exposure to ill persons, while ensuring that women receive essential care, means identifyingpotential cases before entry at health service points, delaying routine appointments and using strict isolation and infection control measures to limit transmission to other patients and staff.[6] In low- resource health systems, putting these recommendations in place may not always be feasible. Dealing with COVID-19 is likely to create imbalances in health care provision, disruption of routine essential services and to require redeployment of scarce health personnel across health services},

abstract = {Big data becomes a challenge in more and more domains. In many areas, such as in social networks, the entities of interest have relational references to each other and thereby form large-scale graphs (in the order of billions of vertices). At the same time, querying and updating these data structures is a key requirement. Complex queries and updates demand expressive high-level languages which can still be efficiently executed on these large-scale graphs. In this paper, we use the well-studied concepts of graph transformation rules and units as a high-level modeling language with declarative and operational features for transforming graph structures. In order to apply them to large-scale graphs, we introduce an approach to distribute and parallelize graph transformations by mapping them to the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model. Our tool support builds on Henshin as modeling tool and consists of a code generator for the BSP framework Apache Giraph. We evaluated the approach with the IMDB movie database and a computation cluster with up to 48 processing nodes with 8 cores each. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Today's health-care providers face growing criticism from policy makers and patients alike. As costs continue to spiral upward and concerns about quality of care escalate, the debate has focused on how to finance health care. Yet funding solutions can't address the underlying questions: Why have costs risen in the first place? And how can we improve the quality and affordability of care? InDesigning Care, Harvard Business School professor Richard Bohmer argues that these fundamental questions must be answered. A medical doctor himself, Bohmer explains that health-care professionals are tasked with providing two very different types of care - sequential and iterative. With sequential care, a patient can be quickly diagnosed and given predictable, reliable, and low-cost care. But in the case of iterative care, a patient's condition is unknown, and tremendous resources may be required for diagnosis and treatment, often with uncertain outcomes. Bohmer shows that to reduce costs and manage care effectively, sequential and iterative care situations require different management systems. Through stories and cases drawn from years in the field, he reveals how health-care providers can successfully manage both modes. To do so, they must reevaluate traditional roles and embrace continuous learning across the organization. The benefits of this operational redesign? The predictable, responsive, and lower-cost care today's health-care leaders - and patients - seek.},

@article{Matthias2016,
abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how operations strategy and Lean concepts can be applied within a healthcare organisation and the degree to which both Lean and operations strategy are understood by senior-level National Health Service (NHS) personnel, based on the process of ongoing longitudinal cases studies. Further interviews and data analysis will examine actual performance of Lean capabilities within the NHS. Design/methodology/approach: For this explanatory multiple-case study project the authors collected data through semi-structured interviews with executives in the NHS to understand how operations strategies are developed in the NHS and implemented in NHS hospitals. The unit of analysis is the hospital. Multiple (22) interviews took place over 12 months with senior-level personnel responsible for implementing change via operations strategy goals, and incorporating Lean initiatives. In addition, to triangulate data, the authors examined healthcare reports and strategy policy documents from each case hospital. This forms stage 1 of a longitudinal study which will examine the actual performance of Lean within the NHS hospitals across a range of operations parameters and explore links between such capabilities and the role and importance of operations strategy in more detail. Findings: The findings lead to the conclusion that operations strategies were not fully developed within the hospitals. In addition, the ongoing data capture shows that “Best practice” was not being disseminated across the NHS, for either patient experience or organisational effectiveness and the role of operations strategy was not fully clear other than as a rather vague “umbrella” term. Despite Lean's attraction for healthcare at a micro-level, significant operational and cultural hurdles must be overcome for the full strategic benefits of Lean to be realised. A much more holistic approach in providing a full service for the whole of the patient journey is needed. Research limitations/implications: The sample provides an initial snapshot. A larger number of hospitals and/or further longitudinal research will be needed to deepen understanding of embedding strategic change to improve overall performance. Practical implications: Tackling cultural performance and operational issues at a macro-level could help healthcare providers reconcile the perceived conflicting goals of improving patient care (i.e. service delivery) whilst simultaneously reducing costs. The role of explicit operations strategies could be pivotal in designing and implementing such change. Originality/value: This research builds on and extends the work of Toussaint and Berry (2013), Seddon and O'Donovan (2010) and Carlborg and Kowalkowski (2013). The authors highlight how some of the apparent contradictions in the requirements of the various stakeholders create operational and strategic tensions. The authors highlight the multi-faceted nature of design and delivery of a multi-touchpoint service within the complexity of a large healthcare provider.},

abstract = {The present study evaluates how five sectors of two Brazilian hospitals have implemented lean healthcare concepts in their operations. The main characteristics of the implementation process are analyzed in the present study: the motivational factor for implementation, implementation time, form (consultancy or internal), team (hospital and consultants), lean implementation continuity/sustainability, lean healthcare tools and methods implemented, problems/improvement opportunities, lean healthcare barriers faced during the implementation process, and critical factors that affected the implementation and the results obtained in each case. The case studies indicate that reducing patient lead times and costs and making financial improvements were the primary factors that motivated lean healthcare implementation in the hospitals studied. Several tools and methods were used in the cases studied, especially value stream mapping and DMAIC. The barriers found in both hospitals are primarily associated with the human factor. Additionally, the results obtained after implementation were analyzed and improvements in financial aspects, productivity and capacity, and lead time reduction of the analyzed sectors were observed. Further, this study also exhibited four propositions elaborated from the results obtained from the cases that highlighted barriers and challenges to lean healthcare implementation in developing countries. Two of these barriers are hospital organizational structure (and, consequently, how the senior management works with medical staff), and outsourcing hospital activities. This study also concluded that the initialization and maintenance of lean healthcare implementation rely heavily on external support because lean healthcare subject knowledge is not yet available in the healthcare organization, which represents a challenge.
